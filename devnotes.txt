Fix issue with Zero Quantity, right now zero quantity is causing a crash.. need to prevent this.
Part of this issues is in the sale model itself potentially... in the save method
Once an item gets to zero it needs to bump over to a Sold Items page..

I am noticing a different price in the unrealized profit (green and red)  and the profit printing out to the box on the 
single metals page.. I believe it is because the SPOT price that i am putting in is changing that fast. So we need to 
regulate that.. maybe have one spot price in a table and then only update it when the user clicks..

**********************************
 cost_per_oz = round(((metal_object.cost_to_purchase + metal_object.shipping_cost) / metal_object.weight_troy_oz), 2) 
 Issue with this in the singleMetal view.... cost_per_oz is wrong if one item sells.. It needs to be calculated and saved
 potentially on the initial purchase.

**********************************
For Sold To on single metal page I want to print out a list of all the names, and have them potentially link to the sale
that occured to that person on a seperate page.

It would be good to get a good API set up so that my prices arent futures prices anymore... Thats kind of a pain in the
ass and set up some kind of table with the spot prices that I can pull from because of loading times etc... Give them
the option to update pricing but hold it steady for the moment if they dont and pull prices from it.
