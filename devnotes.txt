Have an issue with the premium... somehow is calculating wrong when i added silver... check it on everything..

**********************************
need to add purity to the equation when calculating total weight of silver..... if silver is not .999 or .9999
actually need to change to have asw agw apw or else calculate troy ounces x purity or something, further thought required

check to see if my ajax needs a csrf..

Just fixed the issue where on the singlemetal page the gram was saying grams if there was only one.. changed this 
from object_weight (which was coming from the view... to metal_object.weight_troy_oz or grams... look to see if
my code was redundant or if there was a reason i had it this way..)

**********************************
Also noticed that cost per ounce is calculating but here for instance the weight is in grams.... not ounces..
so this is actually cost per gram the way that i have it put in.. so grams and ounces need to change dynamically
on the single metal page (maybe others too) in the bottom right box.

**********************************
Need to think more about AGW ASW APW... when adding junk metal the actual weights are not really available.. 
so these would probably be added based off of the ASW (because only coins had silver. but could still be an issue
with not pure gold coins as well. or platinum if they are made this way)

Would be interesting to have a collections section.... You would have to be able to set up a "collection" with a certain amount of items/placeholders,
similair to what we have here but with no actual data entered yet and no pictures (or picures) uploaded and position holders for coins that were not 
in the collection... Need to DEFINITLEY track premiums paid on these pieces because they are so far above spot price generally and this is something 
that someone would need to know... How much premium was paid over spot.. Also it would be good to have some information filled in about each item... 
maybe the mintage number, rarity of the piece on a 1-100 scale.... condition of the coin, potentially option for more than one photo?? maybe also a 
link to the most recent EBAY sales on this item (research if this is possible)  




For the basics for the site, and to put it bluntly, people need to be able to add and remove metals, track the current prices of the metals and the 
prices that were paid. They need to know what the premium they paid over spot was and what they need to pay to break even on their purchase. 
purchase cost plus shipping.....The big problem that I am trying to solve here is this...

People need to know what they have, and log all the possible information about it so that if they have any kind of mishap or issue, others will know 
the true value of their collections. Giving them the freedom to continue collecting their favorite pieces and not have to liquidate collections as 
they get older to trade for generic metals...


to have a forum where people could trade would also be an awesome future project, for example, if collections were a thing. and users could see 
eachothers wishlists. then it would be possible to make offers to users based on their wish list... interesting concept to have a wishlist as well.

messaging platform for trading between users would be interesting
adding 2 factor identification with a google log in would be a great idea.
another feature to build out would be the csv export, or an excel export...
it would be nice to know the total sales in a given time period....
it would be nice to know total value of metals in possession vs total spent
it would be nice to know the value of collections once that gets integrated....
at the end of the day the most important is money in, money available, and money out....
would be nice to know the ROI for a given time period... Monthly , yearly, custom, weekly etc...
look into charting all of the data, how is this possible
 
filters to track items would be good when you have all of the metals, a sort by (higest unrealized profit), (purchase date), (hightest cost),
(lowest cost), (lowest unrealized profit)
