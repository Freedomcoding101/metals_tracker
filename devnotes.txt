To work on..

forgot password name/page/url/ information..

set up edit account to reirect to an account page maybe??
or something better than the homepage?



**********************************
Line 37 to 49 in the searchreturn.html need to have the styles actually put into a css..

**********************************
need to have quantity for sell... maybe you have 12 but you only sell 3.... 
quantity is in form... should be updating properly when the form is filled out.. Going to continue working on this..
Not sure if it is properly updating... causing errors.. also check the csrf token... and add try/except blocks to see what the issue is..
Seems something is returning as ZERO afterwards.

currently weight, weight_grams, weight_troy_oz are all going to ZERO after this form submits lol

**********************************
add placeholders to form.... need to specifically say for weight that it is the TOTAL weight not weight per item..
 
**********************************
Simplify gold page and single gold page with the weight_per_unit now instead of the fancy formula if you wish..

**********************************
If someone updates the weight the weight_grams and weight_troy ounce needs to recalculate (it wont be none so it will skip it..)

**********************************
Silver is giving the DCA of Gold ahahahhahaah Fuck

**********************************
Profit/Loss needs to be refactored.... Fuck

******************************************\
Set Delete so that if you accidentally double click the button it ignores the second click...
